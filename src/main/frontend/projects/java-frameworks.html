                When I started this project I was given a Spring application with a Java backend,
                a generic HTML user interface to use in the design and development of the system, and a UML class diagram.
                I was tasked with learning how to customize the application to any customers needs.
                I began by creating a README file where I logged all the changes I made to the original program.
                Then I customized the HTML adding a site name, products, and parts.
                I added a page about the company with navigation to and from the main page.
                I also created a sample inventory with products and parts.
                Then I added a buy now button with an accompanying success or fail message.
                After that I changed the code to include an enforced minimum and maximum inventory with an error message if there isn't enough current inventory.
                Finally, I wrote some unit tests to verify the program and deleted redundant code to keep everything clean and smooth.
