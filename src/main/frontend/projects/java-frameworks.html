                Java Frame works is a college project I worked on.
                The website is a generic inventory manager for stores that can be adjusted
                to the needs of any client.
                When I started this project I was given a Spring application with a partial Java backend,
                a generic HTML user interface to use in the design and development of the system,
                and a UML class diagram.
                I was tasked with customizing an application to any client needs via
                a use of Java, HTML, REST APIs, and Bootstrap.

                I began by creating a README file where I logged all the changes I made to the
                original program.
                Then I customized the HTML adding a store name, products names, and part names.
                I added a sample page about the company with navigation to and from the main page.
                I also created a sample inventory with products and parts using Bootstrap.
                Then I added a buy now button with an accompanying success or fail message.
                After that I changed the code to include an enforced minimum and maximum inventory
                with an error message if there isn't enough current inventory.
                Finally, I wrote some unit tests to verify the program and deleted redundant
                code to keep everything clean and smooth.
