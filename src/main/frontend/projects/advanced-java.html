            <p>
                Advanced Java Is a College project that allows me to show my proficiency with
                Docker, Multithreaded Spring Applications, Node.js, HTML, Java, Spring Applications,
                RESTful APIs, TypeScript, and Angular.
                As I began this project I was given a Spring application with a Java back-end
                and an Angular front-end.
                In this project I was tasked with to modify the Landon Hotel scheduling
                application to meet new requirements as a multithreaded application.

            <p>
                I began by building a resource bundle with the English and French languages
                and writing a welcome message for each language.
                After, I wrote a class to generate a thread for each language welcome message
                using a thread pool.
                Then I passed each thread to the front-end using TypeScript to display each message.
                Following that I modified the HTML to display the price for a reservation in US dollars,
                Canadian dollars, and euros.
                Next, I added a class to convert and format ET, MT, and UTC time zones.
                I passed the formatted times to the front-end using TypeScript to display the
                time of each time zone.
                Finally, I created a Docker file to include all code.
                Which I tested by creating and running an image of the Spring Application.
