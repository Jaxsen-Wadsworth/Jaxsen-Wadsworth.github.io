                I demonstrate in this project the use of Spring applications, SQL databases, and RESTful API.
                In this project I was given a recently upgraded Angular front-end with an outdated Java back-end,
                along with an EDR diagram and UML Class diagram.
                I was tasked to port over any mission-critical functionalities to a modern framework
                via developing a minimally viable product (MVP) to migrate the legacy back-end to the
                modern Spring framework.
                I began by constructing new packages for controllers, entities, DAO, and services.
                I wrote the code in the entities package following the design in the UML diagram.
                Then I created repository interfaces for the entities and placed them in the DAO package
                while adding cross-origin support.
                In the service package I first created a purchase data class with a customer cart and a set of cart items.
                Then I wrote a purchase response data class that returns an order tracking number.
                Followed by a checkout service interface and a checkout service implementation class.
                I added five sample customers to verify the program wasn't rewriting data.
                Finally, I ran the program adding a customer order adding a vacation with multiple excursions.
                I verified the database tables using MySQL Workbench to show the data was successfully added.
