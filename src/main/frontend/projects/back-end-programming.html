            <p>
                Back-end Programming is a college project that allows me to demonstrate
                the use of Spring applications, SQL databases, RESTful APIs, Java, HTML, TypeScript and
                efficient communication from the front-end to the back-end and back.
                In this project I was given a recently overhauled Angular front-end with
                an outdated Java back-end, along with an EDR diagram and UML Class diagram.
                For this project I was tasked to port over any mission-critical functionalities to a
                modern framework via developing a minimally viable product (MVP) to migrate the
                legacy back-end to the modern Spring framework.

            <p>
                I began by constructing new packages for controllers, entities, DAO, and services.
                I wrote the code in the entities package following the design in the UML diagram.
                Then I created repository interfaces for the entities and placed them in the DAO package
                while adding cross-origin support.
                In the service package I first created a purchase data class with a customer cart and a set of cart items.
                Then I wrote a purchase response data class that returns an order tracking number.
                Followed by a checkout service interface and a checkout service implementation class.
                I added five sample customers to verify the program wasn't rewriting data.
                Finally, I ran the program adding a customer order adding a vacation with multiple excursions.
                I verified the database tables using MySQL Workbench to show the data was successfully added.
