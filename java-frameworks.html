            When I started this project I was given a Spring application with a Java backend,
            a generic HTML user interface to use in the design and development of the system, and a UML class diagram.
            I was tasked with learning how to customize the application to any customers needs.
            I began by creating a README file where I logged all the changes I made to the original program.
            Then I customized the HTML adding a site name, products, and parts.
            I added a page about the company with navigation to and from the main page.
